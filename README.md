“ByteWave”, an Internet Service Provider (ISP) Management System is a C-based console application designed 
to simulate core functionalities of a website based Internet Service Provider’s user and administrator interfaces.
It allows a user to sign up, log in, select plans that they wish to use and have an user interface to manage data plans 
and check for billing information, while the administrator can manage user data, update plan details such as changing prices, internet speed, and send billing notifications to users. This system demonstrates file handling, structure usage, nested functions for console interface design according to real life counterparts and a logical flow control in C programming language.
